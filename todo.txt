Making a quick tool for my gamejam gamejam

reference:
Want to use this as a neat rendering technique:
http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/asciiart/

will generate some images for different parts and then use that technique to render them as ascii

an excellent note here!

This font might help:

next steps:
-render some imagery in realtime perhaps?
-see about creating animation in the pre text...

Future improvements:
-add animation?
-some kind of 'curses' style system within the rendered image?
